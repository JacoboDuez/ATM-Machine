# ATM-Machine
This ATM project was developed using React JSX,HTML  and CSS for styling the application.
This application contains basic constraints to block the user form performing a withdrawal with insufficient funds.
Also, some UI features such as the button (input) and the input box are disabled whenever the amount to withdraw or deposit is <= 0.
Some basic CSS features are included such as the hover over effect and transitions of color in the buttons.
